2. REPORT DETAILS
-----------------
LUTAR-1#1 Warning
LUT drives async reset alert  
LUT cell PC_0/D_FF1/LoadSelect_reg_i_2, with 2 or more inputs, drives asynchronous reset pin(s) InsDec_0/LoadSelect_reg/CLR. The LUT may glitch and trigger an unexpected reset, even if it is a properly timed path.
Related violations: <none>

LUTAR-1#2 Warning
LUT drives async reset alert  
LUT cell PC_0/D_FF2/Add_Sub_reg_i_2, with 2 or more inputs, drives asynchronous reset pin(s) InsDec_0/Add_Sub_reg/PRE. The LUT may glitch and trigger an unexpected reset, even if it is a properly timed path.
Related violations: <none>

LUTAR-1#3 Warning
LUT drives async reset alert  
LUT cell RegBank_A/Reg_2/Address_reg[2]_i_1, with 2 or more inputs, drives asynchronous reset pin(s) InsDec_0/JmpFlag_reg/PRE. The LUT may glitch and trigger an unexpected reset, even if it is a properly timed path.
Related violations: <none>
